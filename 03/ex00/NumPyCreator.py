class NumPyCreator:
	"""
	• from_list(self, lst): takes a list or nested lists and returns its corresponding Numpy array.
	• from_tuple(self, tpl): takes a tuple or nested tuples and returns its corresponding Numpy array.
	• from_iterable(self, itr): takes an iterable and returns an array which contains all its elements.
	• from_shape(self, shape, value): returns an array filled with the same value.
	The first argument is a tuple which specifies the shape of the array, and the second
	argument specifies the value of the elements. This value must be 0 by default.
	• random(self, shape): returns an array filled with random values. It takes as an
	argument a tuple which specifies the shape of the array.
	• identity(self, n): returns an array representing the identity matrix of size n
