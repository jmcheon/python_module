# Python Module 01

> ***Summary : The goal of the module is to get familiar with object-oriented programming and much more.***

| Exercise |             Title              |                         Description                          |

|    00    |            The Book            | The goal of the exercise is to get you familiar with the notions of classes <br/>and the manipulation of the objects related to those classes.       |
|    01    |           Family tree          | The goal of the exercise is to tackle the notion inheritance of class. |
|    02    |           The Vector           | The goal of the exercise is to get you used with built-in methods, more particularly with<br/>those allowing to perform operations. Student is expected to code built-in methods for<br/>vector-vector and vector-scalar operations as rigorously as possible. |
|    03    |           Generator!           | The goal of the exercise is to discover the concept of generator object in Python. |
|    04    |      Working with lists        | The goal of the exercise is to discover 2 useful methods for lists, tuples, dictionnaries<br/>(iterable class objects more generally) named zip and enumerate. |
|    05    |          Bank Account          | The goals of this exercise is to discover new built-in functions and deepen your class<br/>manipulation and to be aware of possibility to modify instanced objects.<br/>In this exercise you learn how to modify or add attributes to an object. |
