|    00    |             $PATH              |      The first thing you need to do is install Python.       |
|    01    |           Rev Alpha            | Make a program that takes a string as argument, <br/>reverses it, swaps its letters case and print the result. |
|    02    | The Odd, the Even and the Zero | Make a program that takes a number as argument.<br/>checks whether it is odd, even or zero, and print the result. |
|    03    |        Functional file         | Create a function called text_analyzer that takes a single string argument<br/>and displays the sums of its upper-case characters, lower-case characters, <br/>punctuation characters and spaces. |
|    04    |           Elementary           | Write a program that takes two integers A and B as arguments and prints the result |

|    06    |            A recipe            | Part 1: Nested Dictionaries<br />Part 2: A series of Helpful Functions<br />Part 3: A command line executable ! |
|    07    |   Shorter, faster, pythonest   | Make a program that takes a string S and an integer N as argument <br/>and print the list of words in S that contains more than N non-punctuation characters. |
|    08    |             S.O.S              | Make a program that takes a string as argument and encode it into Morse code. |

|    10    |          Loading bar!          | You are about to discover the yield operator,<br/> create a function called ft_progress(lst) that will display the progress of a for loop. |
